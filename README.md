# reactor-experiments

Small experiments & demos built on the Reactor developer platform.

All examples use the **[Livecore](https://docs.reactor.inc/overview)** model — a frame-level autoregressive framework for real-time and interactive long video generation.

## Examples

### [`livecore/`](./livecore)

A minimal demo showing the basics of the Reactor JS SDK. Enter a text prompt or record your voice, and watch Livecore generate video in real time. A good starting point for understanding how to connect to the model, schedule prompts, and display output with `ReactorView`.

### [`film-director/`](./film-director)

A more advanced UI built around the idea of "directing" a video frame by frame. Provides a cinematic control panel for scheduling prompts across specific frames, with fullscreen support and live generation tracking.
